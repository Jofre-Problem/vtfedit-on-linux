# vtfedit-on-linux

This repo is made for people to manage to run VTFEdit on Linux, using Bottles.

## Install Bottles:

flatpak install flathub com.usebottles.bottles

## Use the yml file for the bottle:

If you experience any problem on saving files, change the Windows version to Windows XP.

## Why?

I was using the AUR vtfedot-pkgbuild using yay.
However, this didnt work and drive me crazy.
BAsed on the .sh I managed luckily to be able to recreate the wineprefix, noticing that the ARCH used should be 64.
Nice!

## Misc 

VTFEdit icon is created using an AI upscaled program.
The winepredix will take like 1.2GB, due to DOTNET35SP1
